# First SHell Project (FiSH) 
(Nathan Gallone & Titouan Degieux @SatysFaction)

FiSH is able to :

	-- run intenal commands
		- exit
		- cd (with or without '~' character at the beginning of the path requested)

	-- redirect stdin and stdout

	-- run external commands
		- as background/foreground tasks
		- with or without pipes between processes

	-- manage zombie processes
	wether they are background or foreground
	
	- Manage SIG_INT signal to stop foreground processes

Bugs are remaining.

----------------------------------------------

possible upgrades :

- patterns management for file names etc

- Default access authorizations are ---x--x--- files created via the touch command have ---------- authorization.
Should find a way to change this without using chmod
